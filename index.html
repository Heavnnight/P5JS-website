        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Hi! I'm Fai. I'm from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and I'm currently a second year in design and technology Game Design track. I love developing games, and exploring how games can tell stories in unique ways. I'm very into 3D art and world building and I can use Maya a little! I'm currently learning Unity, and in the future I want to learn Unreal Engine too. I'm obsessed with nostalgic PlayStation 2 games, and my favorite game ever is Silent Hill, its atmosphere and psychological horror style inspire a lot of my creativity. When I'm not studying, I'm usually playing games, streaming sometimes, or experimenting with random creative ideas for fun.</p>

                    <h3>ASSIGNMENT 1: LOST AND FOUND</h3>
                    <p>This project is a simple p5.js sketch where I recreated a street described by my classmate. The scene includes different buildings, shops, and a train station along a busy street. I focused on using basic shapes, colors, and proportions to build a full environment.
Even though the details like windows and doors are not perfect, the sketch captures the overall atmosphere of the place. This was my first time creating a full scene in p5.js, so I learned how to position shapes, layer elements, and build a composition step by step.</p>

                    <p>This project is an interactive face generator created in p5.js. The face changes shape and expression based on mouse movement, and its colors shift when the user presses the C key. I used parameters to control different features such as the face size, eyes, mouth, eyebrows, and blush.
The goal was to make the face react naturally to interaction, so I experimented with numbers and proportions until the movement felt smooth. Instead of redrawing the face every time, using variables allowed me to create many expressions from a single structure.</p>

                    <p>This project is an experimental clock that represents time through the four seasons instead of numbers. Every few seconds, the scene changes to a different season: winter shows snow and a moon, spring includes rain, summer has a bright sun, and fall features orange leaves. The idea behind the project is that seasons naturally represent the passage of time and change. Even though the concept is simple, the clock visually communicates time in a calm, symbolic way rather than through numbers or hands.</p>

                    <p>This character was created as part of a group Exquisite Corpse project. Each of us designed a different section of the body: the head, torso, and legs without seeing the other parts. After drawing, we combined all our designs and developed a shared backstory that connected our three characters into one bizarre creature. We folded the paper into three parts and assigned each person a section to draw. After revealing the full creature, we started building a narrative that explained how these separate characters merged into one being. The result is a collaborative character with a strange but funny origin story that reflects all our ideas together.</p>

                    <h3>ASSIGNMENT 5: OPTICAL ILLUSION</h3>
                    <p>For this project, I explored optical illusions that create a sense of depth using only color, scale, and geometric repetition. I was especially inspired by illusions built from repeated squares, which often make the viewer feel as if they’re falling into a tunnel. Using this idea, I experimented with different colors, sizes, and spacing to create an illusion that feels endless and visually alive.
Working on this sketch was surprisingly fun because even small numerical changes in the code completely transformed the effect. This project helped me understand how simple shapes can create strong visual impact when combined with motion and repetition.</p>

                    <h3>ASSIGNMENT 6: DATA PORTRAIT</h3>

                    <p>This assignment asked us to create a “data portrait” using information from our own lives instead of drawing a traditional self-portrait. The goal was to choose a specific habit or pattern, collect data about it, and then turn that data into a visual system that represents something about who we are.</p>
                    <p>For my data portrait, I chose to track how many times I watched TikTok in the bathroom. It’s a small and kind of embarrassing habit, but also funny and very real. I used a 600×600 canvas to show a simple scene of a person sitting with their phone, and the data appears through small changes on the screen and in the text. The colors and numbers on the phone, and the text at the top, change to represent how often I did this habit over time. I kept the visual style simple because I wanted the concept to be clear and easy to understand.</p>

                    <h3>ASSIGNMENT 7: AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL GAME</h3>
<p>For this assignment, the goal was to create a small autobiographical game that represents something from my everyday life using simple mechanics and visuals. Instead of writing a story directly, the game needed to express the idea through interaction—how the player moves, what they collect, and what they avoid.

In my game, I chose to explore the difference between healthy food and junk food, because it’s something I deal with in my daily routine. Sometimes choosing the healthy option feels easy, and other times it feels impossible. I wanted to turn this simple struggle into a playful experience. The player moves around the screen trying to collect healthy items while avoiding junk food, which creates a quick and clear message without needing any text or instructions.</p>
